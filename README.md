# Covid-19-Virus-Detection
Hey there, 
let me walk you through our innovative COVID-19 detection project. I kick-started with an in-depth exploratory data analysis, uncovering patterns and correlations within symptom data. Next, I deployed various machine learning algorithms to accurately classify cases based on symptoms like fever, shortness of breath, sore throat, headaches, and more. My mission? To harness the power of data-driven insights to bolster early detection efforts, ultimately contributing to effective containment strategies and safeguarding public health. Join me on this journey as we leverage technology to combat the COVID-19 pandemic head-on.
